"""`generate_media` — the tool the game asks for its own art with.

What is pinned here is the ANSWER, not the render: the model gets the path the file will live at
while the render is still queued, and writes code against it. A bad id, a blocked prompt and an
exhausted budget all come back as text instead, because a build that cannot have art has to be told
to draw one rather than left waiting for a file that is never coming.
