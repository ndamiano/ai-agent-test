"""Starting a build over an EMPTY game folder.

A second attempt at the same prompt used to open on the dead build's half-written files. The model
reads them, believes them, and re-asks for art it already has under new ids — measured 2026-08-01:
three naming schemes for one cast, 40 renders, no finished game. `fresh` is the from-scratch button;
a plain re-trigger, a resume and a fix all still carry the folder forward.
