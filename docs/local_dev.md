# Running Maestro locally

Everything needed to bring the platform up on one box, and the settings that decide how it behaves.
`docs/deploy.md` is the same story for prod.

---

## Bring it up

Four things run: the control plane, the frontend, whatever serves the models, and one worker per
queue (four queues: `llm`, `image`, `mesh`, `video`). The control plane touches no GPU at all — the
worker-pull queue is the only transport — so a queue with no worker means every job on it times out.

**Backend** — `source venv/bin/activate && python run.py`

**Frontend** — `cd frontend && npm run dev`

**Workers** — `scripts/local_gpu.py` starts them (below), and it is the only way to: a worker
row is created, priced, before the worker runs — the scaler does it for a pod at the pod's rate,
`local_gpu.py` does it for this box at zero — and a claim from a worker id nobody created is
refused, so a bare `python -m worker.agent` never lands a job. `video` targets the same ComfyUI
instance as `image` (MiniMax-H3 runs there too) and needs `SAFETY_MODEL_DIR` for the same reason
`image` does — every frame the sheet is built from gets an NSFW verdict.

**One card, four queues, `auto`** — a world build (`compose_world`, or `worldgen.build.build_world`
by hand) alternates llm/image/mesh jobs many times and
blocks until each completes, so there is no point at which the legs can be drained "one at a time
by hand". `scripts/local_gpu.py auto` runs the control plane's other half instead: it polls all
four queues, starts (model + worker) whichever has pending work — favoring the queue it already
holds so a momentary empty doesn't thrash it, except that a queue whose oldest job has waited
ten minutes takes the card, because the control plane fails a job nobody claims in thirty and a
build's turns can keep the llm queue non-empty for an hour — and stops what it started on
SIGINT/SIGTERM. Handing the card over waits up to `HANDOFF_SECONDS` for the worker to finish the
job it holds, because that generation is already paid for and a killed turn re-pays its prefill
when the job is re-driven. A server already on the port is USED rather than refused — it belongs to
whoever started it, and auto never stops it — so another ComfyUI on 8188 no longer costs auto the
queue, or the card it was holding. The engine for an llm leg is the one built for the model
variant in settings (`ninfer-<variant>` beside `ninfer/`), which `NINFER_BIN` overrides. Run it
in one terminal alongside `python run.py`; `--idle-exit SECONDS` stops and exits once nothing is
pending anywhere for that long (default: never). The single-leg (`llm`/`image`/`mesh`/`video`) and
`all` modes still exist for draining one queue by hand.

A build that calls `compose_world` needs `auto` for the same reason: the world's stages and the
build's own turns share the llm queue, and its art rides the other two while the build keeps
writing code.

**CI locally** — `scripts/ci.sh` runs every job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (pytest, ruff,
eslint, tsc, vitest, vite build) and prints one verdict per step. Run it before a push.

**Pre-commit** — `git config core.hooksPath scripts/githooks`, once per clone. Git honours ONE
hook path, so everything a commit is checked against lives in that directory. It runs the comment
audit (`comment-audit.py`: every comment line the commit adds, listed to answer for itself against
the standard in `CLAUDE.md`; a terminal answers y/N, a non-interactive commit is blocked and
re-run with `COMMENTS_REVIEWED=1`), then `ci.sh` scoped to what the commit stages: eslint +
typecheck + vitest for `frontend/`, ruff + the backend suite for Python. It deselects `-m browser`
— the dozen tests that launch a real headless chromium — and CI runs those. `--no-verify` skips
the lot.

**Tests** — `python -m pytest tests/ -q -n auto` (`requirements-dev.txt` holds pytest, xdist,
httpx for the TestClient, and ruff; the suite is
process-parallel, 36 s serial against 9 s here), frontend
`cd frontend && npm test` (vitest).

## Model servers

### LLM — ninfer (preferred on a 5090)

Same weights in its own artifact, ~3x llama.cpp's decode rate on the same card (194.5 vs 63.3
tok/s), compiled for `sm_120a` alone. It serves `chat` only.

```
<ninfer>/build/apps/ninfer-serve \
  <model>.ninfer \
  --model-id qwen3.8_27b \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8090 \
  --max-context 131072 \
  --spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft \
  --presence-penalty 0 \
  --cors \
  --vision \
  --kv-dtype int8 \
  --preserve-thinking
```

`--spec dflash2` is the DFlash2 drafter packed in the artifact beside the MTP head: measured 1.27–1.62× MTP3's decode on the design chain, flat at ~200 tok/s where MTP sags as the sequence grows (`docs/experiments.md`). `--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3` still runs from the same file.
`--vision` is what lets a worldgen build show the model its own renders — the refine stages send
images, and a server launched without it refuses every image-bearing turn (`vision_disabled`).
Its fixed GPU allocations come out of the same card as the weights and KV, and they are the
margin: `scripts/local_gpu.py` serves exactly `<llm.model>.ninfer` from `NINFER_MODELS` because a
larger variant artifact of the same model left no room for them and died at launch.
`--presence-penalty 0` is load-bearing: ninfer's sampler defaults to Qwen3 thinking defaults,
penalty 1.0 among them, which degrades long structured output. There is no `--no-thinking`:
thinking is `llm.reasoning` (below), sent as `reasoning_effort` on every call, and ninfer has no
thinking-budget flag — the build's per-turn output cap, `n_ctx − prompt`, is what bounds it,
because ninfer admits a request only when prompt + max_tokens fits `--max-context`. `--model-id`
must match `llm.model` in settings.json.
`--preserve-thinking` is what makes a build's turns hit the cache. The build sends each turn's
thinking back, so the next request extends the sequence the server already holds and prefills
only the new tail. Without the flag ninfer renders every assistant turn before the latest user
message — a nudge, a compaction note — without its thinking, the prefix diverges there, and each
turn re-prefills the window from that point. The log line's `reuse=append_frontier` is a hit.

### LLM — llama.cpp

```
llama-server \
  --models-dir <model dir> \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
  -ngl 99 \
  -c 131072 \
  -fa on \
  --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0 \
  --jinja \
  --reasoning-budget 0 \
  --chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}' \
  --spec-type draft-mtp \
  -np 4
```

`--chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}'` is load-bearing and `--reasoning-budget 0`
alone is a no-op: without it Qwen3.6 thinks in `content` and authoring turns truncate at the output
cap before the tool call. `-fa on` plus q8_0 KV keeps the cache from spilling out of VRAM into host
RAM.

Set `-c` and `llm.n_ctx` to the same number — see the settings note below for why both directions
hurt.

### Images — ComfyUI

Local: `comfy-start`. Over the network: run `main.py --listen 0.0.0.0` from the Comfy checkout.

### Anims — the video leg shares this ComfyUI

MiniMax-H3 (pruned int8) runs as core ComfyUI nodes, not a separate server: the `video` queue's
worker points at the same instance as `image`. It needs mess-with-comfy 0.30.1 or later (that's
where the MiniMax nodes landed) with the weights under `/var/lib/models/image` alongside the image
checkpoints, and ~30 GB of VRAM for a clip — nothing else runs on the card while a `video` job is
in flight, same as the mesh/image exclusion below.

Nothing enqueues on `video` today: MiniMax-H3's license does not cover the US (`docs/models.md`),
so a silhouette no skeleton fits ships as its still. The leg stays wired for the next model.

### Meshes — TRELLIS

```
<trellis venv>/bin/python src/tools/trellis_server.py \
  --repo <trellis repo> --weights <trellis weights> --stage-dir ""
```

A one-GPU box holds ComfyUI or TRELLIS, not both at once — which is why an asset top-up resumes a
mesh from its `<id>.src.png` rather than restarting at the image leg.

Two launch flags decide whether the server fits in HOST RAM, and a desktop that runs out of it
loses the whole user session to the OOM killer, not just the build (measured twice, 2026-08-21:
a 36 GB python killed at the mesh stage, Chromium and the desktop with it):

- `--stage-dir ""` — by default the server copies its weights into `/dev/shm` (the pod trick
  against a network filesystem dropping pages). On a local disk that copy is 14 GB of tmpfs that
  stays resident for as long as the box is up. Empty means load from `--weights`.
- leave `--ptype` at its `512` default. The server warms `{ptype, "512"}`, so `1024_cascade`
  loads TWO pipelines and the process peaks near 36 GB of host RAM. `scripts/local_gpu.py`
  launches with both settings.

---

## Builds from the CLI

```
cd src && python -m maestro.codegen.run "<request>"     # prompt → build
```

- `--new "<request>"` stops with the prompt on disk so it can be edited first
- `--build <run_id>` builds that stored prompt
- `--change <run_id> "<note>"` changes a built game from a play note
- `--assets <run_id>` re-renders the art the game asked for and never got
- `--history <run_id>` lists a run's snapshots; `--restore <run_id> <ref>` puts the game back to one
- `--evict <run_id>` / `--rehydrate <run_id>` move a run dir to and from S3
- `--archive-all` uploads every settled run that has no archive yet (the nightly sweep in
  `docs/backups.md`)

**Playing a build:** `runtime/games/<run_id>/index.html`. A game is plain browser files, but a 3D
one needs http, not `file://` — `<script type="module">` is CORS-blocked from a file origin.

## Builds on RunPod pods from this box

The prod model on prod pods, driven by the local control plane, through the exact prod path. A
pod never listens; it boots the worker and polls `CP_URL/worker/claim`, so the only thing
this box has to add is a URL a pod can reach.

1. `sudo tailscale funnel --bg 8000` (once: `sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER` lets you do
   it without sudo). `tailscale funnel status` prints the URL. It is a public HTTPS door to
   :8000 — the worker path is bearer-gated like prod, the landing page is not — so
   `sudo tailscale funnel off` when done.
2. In settings.json: prod's `runpod` block (`queues`, templates, volumes; take it from the
   droplet's settings.json) with `enabled: true` and `cp_url` = the funnel URL; `llm` =
   what the pod serves — `model` `pennyroyal`, `n_ctx` 131072, `slots` 2 — because the pod
   refuses to boot on a model mismatch and every request names it. `max_workers: 1` per queue
   bounds spend. `workqueue.job_timeout_seconds` ≥ the longest single call you will queue (a
   100K-token design at xhigh runs past the 1800 s default).
3. Stop `scripts/local_gpu.py auto` and any hand-started worker: a local worker claims the job
   before the pod boots.
   Prod's autoscaler shares the RunPod account and reaps every `maestro-<queue>-*` pod that
   never registered with PROD inside `boot_deadline_seconds` — a pod that registered here dies
   at exactly five minutes. Set `runpod.pod_prefix` to something else (`gsdev`), and then prod
   cannot see these pods and this scaler cannot see prod's.
4. Restart `run.py`; the log says `autoscaler started on runpod`. Then build exactly as usual —
   `python -m maestro.codegen.run "<ask>"`, or a pinned prompt through `run_build`. Scale-from-
   zero fires on the first pending job (the `min_jobs_per_pod` rule only gates a second pod).
   Rent → claim is ~3 min on a warm image; a stock-out shows as `scale-up llm: ... refused`
   every tick and the pending job dies at the reaper's 30 min unless something re-enqueues it.

The pod's own view: `GET /pods/<id>` on the RunPod API (`scaler.runpod_client`) has its env,
uptime and GPU utilisation, and the control-plane log shows its claims and heartbeats arriving
from a RunPod address.

The same from EC2: add the `aws` block (below) with `enabled: true`, keep the llm policy block
in `runpod.queues` (it needs no `template_id` or cards when `runpod.enabled` is false), and the
log says `autoscaler started on aws`. A box is ~3 min from launch to its first claim and ends
itself on idle; `pod_prefix` keeps this scaler and prod's apart in a shared account the same way.

---

## Frontend notes

The palette is CSS variables in `frontend/src/index.css`; `tailwind.config.js` only names them, so
a colour change hot-reloads. Editing the config itself (a new name, a font) needs the dev server
restarted — Node caches the ESM config, and a stale one drops every custom class silently.

---

## Settings

`src/config/settings.json`, gitignored. Copy from `settings.example.json`.

### `llm`

`model`, `n_ctx`, `max_tokens`, `reasoning`, `slots`, `sglang_args`, `ninfer_args`. There is no
endpoint — inference rides the queue.

`slots` is how many jobs one llm worker runs at once against its engine (`worker/agent.py
--slots`); an llm pod reads it at create. The scaler counts workers, not slots, so the llm
queue's `min_jobs_per_pod` is per pod and scales with it: two slots, twice the backlog before a
second card is rented.

`n_ctx` is the INPUT budget: when the prompt ABOUT TO BE SENT — the last one the server counted
plus the rounds added since — leaves less than 16K tokens of it, `build_steps.compact`
stubs every superseded file body and drops the rounds that only read, then stubs the bodies out
of the oldest rounds until a third of the window holds the rest and, only if that is not enough,
drops the oldest whole rounds; every compaction re-grounds the model on the code map and on which
files it has already read unchanged (`CLAUDE.md`). Nothing else trims.

The two `_args` strings are appended to an engine's launch line, one per engine: `ninfer_args` by
`scripts/local_gpu.py` for the 27B on the local 5090 (`--kv-dtype int8` is what lets 131072 fit
it), `sglang_args` by the pod entrypoint for Flash-Next on an RTX PRO 6000 (`docs/deploy.md`).
Prod and the local box run different models on different cards; the build harness is the same.

Set it to the server's `-c`. The local router never reports its window, so both errors are yours to
avoid, and only one of them announces itself:

- **Too large** — nothing trims until the prompt has already overflowed.
- **Too small** — silent. A build whose files no longer fit one read-everything round compacts every
  turn, forgets, re-reads, and grinds to the turn cap. Measured 2026-08-01: a visual novel at
  `-c 32768` spent 31 compactions and ~100 of 120 turns re-reading its own five files.

`max_tokens` is only the connector's default ceiling — the build path passes its own.

`reasoning` is the thinking effort of every llm call, the build included, sent to the engine as
`reasoning_effort`. The Qwen3.8 template takes `none`, `low`, `medium` and `xhigh`; `high` is
rejected (`reasoning_effort_not_supported`). `none` DISABLES thinking, and a non-thinking build is
the "something kinda close" arm of `docs/experiments.md` (2026-08-25), so a build server runs at
`medium` or above. Prod's `LLM_REASONING` default is `none` and ships in the same deploy as the
wire that forwards it — deploying the wire alone turns prod's thinking off.

### The wire format is the worker's, not a setting

The control plane enqueues a CANONICAL chat request; the worker translates it for whatever its own
target serves (`worker.agent --api chat|responses`, default `chat`; see `llm_clients/wire.py`).
`responses` honors `reasoning.effort` as written; `chat` carries it as `reasoning_effort`, which
ninfer reads and llama.cpp ignores.

On `chat` everything else passes through — so **sampling is a launch flag on the target server,
not a request field**, and on llama.cpp so is thinking (see the invocations above). Adding an engine is a
branch in `worker/handlers.llm`, never a settings change.

### `workqueue`

`token` is the worker bearer secret. There is no `enabled` flag and no GPU endpoint on this side.

exec_seconds are debited to the owning game by the `game_id` on the job row, and a job with none is
neither metered nor gated. Build and asset enqueues pass it directly; the one blocking path
(`workqueue/client.py`’s `run_job`, what the connector's `generate_with_tools` rides) reads it off the
`run_scope` contextvar instead — a call there outside a scope spends GPU nobody is charged for.

### `data_dir`

Env `MAESTRO_DATA_DIR`, default `<repo>/data`. Where platform.db + auth.db live — control-plane
state, deliberately not under `working_directory`.

### `play.origin` / `play.app_origin`

Set BOTH to serve games from their own registrable domain; empty means one origin. settings.json
is the only place these live — prod's values are in `docs/deploy.md` "Public domains".

Either way /play auth is the handoff flow: the SPA mints a single-use token
(`POST /api/games/<id>/play-session`), `/handoff` redeems it into a per-game path-scoped grant
cookie, and the served `index.html` gets the console reporter injected on the way out (the game
folder stays pristine). See `docs/deploy.md` "Public domains".

### `smtp`

host/port/username/password/from_address — outbound mail, `tools/mailer.py`. One caller: the
password-reset link, whose address comes from `play.app_origin`. Unconfigured, the forgot-password
endpoint still answers ok (it must not report who has an account) and logs that it could not send —
so a box without it has no account recovery.

### `s3`

endpoint/region/bucket/keys — the off-box run-dir archive. An unconfigured bucket logs and stands
aside.

### `runpod`

The autoscaler (`src/scaler/` + `docs/deploy.md`): `enabled`, `api_key`, `network_volume_id`,
`cp_url` (the pod-reachable control-plane URL), `tick_seconds`, `stale_worker_seconds`, and
per-queue `queues.<name>` scaling blocks (template_id, network_volume_ids, gpu_type_ids,
allowed_cuda_versions, max_workers, thresholds, cooldown, idle_exit_seconds,
boot_deadline_seconds). The `queues` dict
replaces the default wholesale — carry complete blocks. settings.json is the only place the block
lives; `docs/deploy.md` describes what each knob does to a pod. The `video` block is the image
block with its own template id — the same image, told its queue by the scaler.

`gpu_type_ids` is PRIORITY-ORDERED: the scaler asks for the head alone and widens to the whole list
only when RunPod refuses that create, since the cards are not substitutes. Which card a pod GOT is the worker's to report, from the device — a control plane that
records its own request records the first list entry forever (measured 2026-08-01: 879 prod jobs
stamped 5090, the bill entirely RTX PRO 4500).

A pod's price is the provider's own (`workers.usd_per_hour`, written at create: RunPod's
`costPerHr`, or the EC2 rung's spot or on-demand price),
and it is what every job that pod runs debits (`docs/finance_information.md`); there is no rate
table to keep. The admin fleet view shows it beside each queue's provider stock-outs
(`pod_refusals`, see `docs/deploy.md` "Autoscaler"): the outage under way, the count over the last
seven days, and the never-pruned requests-vs-stock-refusals ratio over 60 days and all time;
nothing when zero.

`llm.model` must be what the engine answers to: it reaches the pod as `LLM_MODEL`, and the
autoscaled llm image serves `pennyroyal` and refuses to boot under any other name.

### `aws`

The scaler's second provider (`scaler.ec2_client`, `docs/deploy.md` "Autoscaler"): `enabled`,
`access_key`, `secret_key`, `security_group` and `instance_profile` (both `gs-gpu-worker`, by
name, in the default VPC), and `queues.<name>` launch blocks: `instance_types`, `markets`
(`spot`, `on-demand`), and `amis` by region. Only a region with an ami is priced, launched in
or listed. Scaling policy is not here: a queue scales by its `runpod.queues` block whichever
provider its machines come from. `workers.source` says which provider a row's machine is on, and
an EC2 row's `pod_id` is `<region>/<instance id>`.

### `payments`

`stripe_secret_key`, `stripe_webhook_secret` — the storefront (`api/routers/billing.py`). Both
are required: a box missing either 500s every billing call, and the webhook signs under the
second, so it is never empty where the webhook is reachable. Checkout returns the payer to
`play.app_origin`. Credits also arrive by `auth.cli grant`.

### `demo_games`

`showcase` and `oneshot`, each a list of run ids the landing page serves unauthenticated
(`api/routers/demos.py`). What is served is the snapshot `python -m maestro.demos snapshot <run_id>`
copied into `runtime/demos/` — a listed id with no snapshot is skipped, and no later build of the
run touches the snapshot. Curation is a deploy-time decision: nothing a build does can put a game
here. Both empty means no demo surface.

---

## Environment variables

Everything structured is in settings.json; the env carries only what `.env.example` lists (server
bind, `WORKING_DIRECTORY`, `WORKQUEUE_TOKEN` + its timeouts, the `LLM_*` defaults) plus:

- `MAESTRO_DATA_DIR` — above.
- `MAESTRO_DEV=1` — uvicorn reload, `/docs` + `/redoc` served.
- `MAESTRO_STALE_PENDING_SECONDS` (default 1800) — `workqueue/reaper.py`: a job pending this long with
  nobody claiming it is failed rather than left to hold its budget reservation forever.
- `MAESTRO_LOCAL_LOGS` (default `/tmp/maestro-local`) — where `scripts/local_gpu.py` writes the
  model-server and worker logs it starts.

---

## Reading the platform DB

`scripts/db.py` — stdlib only, runs anywhere the file is: named queries (`cost`, `builds`,
`models`, `failures`, `turns`) and `sql "<text>"` for the rest; `--db` points it at another file, `--since`
at a date. Read it from a snapshot, never the live file (`docs/backups.md` "Query hygiene").
