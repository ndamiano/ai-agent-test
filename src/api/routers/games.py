"""Games router — browse and drive codegen build runs.

A "game" is a games row in the platform db plus its run dir under
<working_directory>/runs/<run_id>/. The list reads the db only; the detail view reads the prompt
from disk (source of truth) and derives live status from the durable build cursor.
Build (which also stores the prompt it was given), pause/resume/stop, fix-from-note, and asset
