"""The public demo surface — the landing page's playable games.

Unauthenticated and read-only, limited to the run ids the OWNER listed in settings
(`demo_games`): curation is a deploy-time decision, never a flag a build can set. The list is
TIERED — `showcase` is what the machine can achieve (playtest notes, fix rounds), `oneshot`
is what a single sentence gets, kept as it first came out — and the tier is the owner's claim,
curated exactly like membership. Playing costs nothing meterable — the files are static and the
grant is an in-memory entry — and the games run on the play origin, which holds no API and no
credential (auth/playgrants.py)."""
