"""compose_world: what the tool answers, what reaches the game folder, and what runs behind it.

The pipeline itself is stubbed — a world costs an hour of GPU — but everything downstream of it
is real: the same `write_job` a build would call, the real publish, the real thread.

The tool answers AT ONCE. It used to block through `construct`, about fifteen minutes, inside a
program whose whole wall-clock budget is 120 seconds — so the call could only ever be killed:
the world landed, the program that asked for it died, and nothing was written to load it
(2026-09-10, run 8988a28a746e — 34 MB of world staged into a game that referenced it nowhere).
