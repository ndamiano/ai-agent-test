"""The compute budget: enqueue is the one gate every producer of GPU work passes through.

A game gets granted_micros when it is charged; workers debit spent_micros as jobs complete. The
hole this closes is the window BETWEEN those two: a build enqueues far faster than workers finish,
so measured spend alone reads near-zero right up to the moment a hundred queued jobs land. Enqueue
therefore reserves each job's per-queue estimate and admits against grant − used − reserved.
