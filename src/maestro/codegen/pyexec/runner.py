"""Run one model-written program and answer with what it printed and what it did.

The program is a build turn's whole action, so this is the boundary the build's trust ends at: it
runs in a separate interpreter that has confined itself with seccomp, holds no environment, and
reaches the project only by asking THIS process to do it. The tools it asks for are the same
`build_tools` the build has always used, so the path jail and every reported failure are unchanged.

A static check runs first. It is not the security boundary — the filter is — but it refuses the
obvious reaches before any code runs, so the model reads "there is no os module here" instead of a
traceback from inside a library it did not know it was calling.
