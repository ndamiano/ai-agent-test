"""The image job a kind resolves to.

A game asks for different KINDS of picture and they want opposite things: a sprite is cut out and
drawn on top of the game, a tile and a scene ARE the background. Rendering all of them through one
item-icon workflow is what matted a floor down to a handful of planks.

A kind picks the graph too: tiles render through DreamShaperXL Turbo with a negative that holds off
the photoreal drift and cracks tiles grow without it; everything else — sprites, scenes, anim
stills, mesh subjects — through the Qwen subject graph, prose verbatim, since the art lab's sprite
re-bake-off (2026-09-04) retired the anime checkpoint.
