"""Stopping a run by hand.

A run with no way to end it is a run that stays live forever — the frontend shows it as building
and the reaper keeps re-driving it — and a job it left pending keeps the autoscaler renting pods
for it. Stop ends everything the run has in flight at whatever stage it is in, and keeps whatever
the model wrote.
