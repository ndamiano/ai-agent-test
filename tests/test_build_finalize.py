"""When a build is allowed to say it is finished.

The gates run AFTER a build finalizes, and a gate that finds an uncaught exception kicks a fix
build. Announcing `built` before they have run shows a person a finished game that cuts back to
mending seconds later — on the web page that is the whole of what they see, and they may be
watching the build happen. So a gated build stages (the gate opens the staged game) and says
nothing until the chain settles.
