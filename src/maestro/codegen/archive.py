"""The run dir's off-box copy, and the disk-pressure valve it enables.

The droplet's disk is finite (measured 2026-08-03: 35 GB, 16 free, ~5.7 MB per game BEFORE art);
the bucket is not. Every settled finalize uploads the whole run dir as one tar.gz — game, art,
game.git history, turn logs — so a finished game exists off-box the moment it exists at all.
`evict` then reclaims local disk, and it REFUSES unless the remote copy is verified first: an
eviction that trusts a write it never checked is a deletion. `rehydrate` pulls the archive back
and re-stages, so an evicted game is a download away from playable or fixable again.

Archiving is a BOUNDARY like snapshots and the error gate: an unconfigured bucket or a failed
upload logs and stands aside — losing the archive is never a reason to lose (or block) a build.
