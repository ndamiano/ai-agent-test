"""`compose_world`'s build face: a world built into the game folder while the build carries on.

The tool ANSWERS AT ONCE with the path the world will appear at, and every stage runs behind it
on one thread for that run — the same bargain `generate_media` strikes, for the same reason. A
program has a wall-clock budget measured in seconds and the ground alone takes about fifteen
minutes, so a tool that waited for it could only ever be killed mid-call: the world landed, the
program that asked for it died, and the code to load it was never written (measured 2026-09-10,
run 8988a28a746e — a 34 MB world staged into a game that referenced it nowhere, paid for in
full).

Nothing is lost by answering early. `world.sizeM` and `world.regions` are read from `world.json`
by the loader in the browser, so a game places its content BY REGION from the loaded world at
runtime, which is where those numbers were always going to come from. What the tool could have
returned was a copy of them, one turn sooner, at the cost of the turn.

The stages PUBLISH in four legs, each ending where what a game draws changes: construct lays the
height field and scatters — from that moment the ground loads and COLLIDES, because the loader
reads collision from the stated heights and never from a GLB — then refinement moves the ground,
objects add meshes and placements, and scene refinement rebuilds them. A publish copies only the
files `world.json` names into `<game>/world/`, then replaces `world.json` itself by rename, so a
browser reading the folder mid-publish never sees a world pointing at a file that is not there
yet. A build that calls `done` while the world is still rendering finalizes on a game whose
ground already loads, and a leg that lands after that re-stages the game people play.

The intermediates stay in `<run_dir>/world_build/` — a quarter of a gigabyte of concept images,
per-region renders and refinement views that no game reads. That folder is also the record that
a world is already coming: the tool refuses a second call rather than replacing the ground under
a game already written against the first one.

A leg that fails is logged and left: the pipeline resumes by stage, so what is published stands
and the world simply stops improving.
