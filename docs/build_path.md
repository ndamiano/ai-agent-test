# The build path, module by module

`CLAUDE.md` holds the laws this code exists to serve; this file is the map. Module docstrings are
the authority on contracts — what is here is the shape and the reasons that are not visible from any
one file. `docs/architecture.md` is the layer above (processes, state, trust boundaries).

runtime/
  vendor/three.module.js  vendored three.js (MIT, self-contained) + GLTFLoader — copied into every
                         game folder at seed, so a 3D game imports a renderer with no network fetch.
  vendor/lib/*.js        the helper library, copied to <game>/lib/ at seed: input.js (WASD and
                         arrows aliased, mouse, touch), audio.js (WebAudio synth, no files: eight
                         named effects, and `sound`/`noise`/`seq`/`loop` for the ones a game
                         invents — a footstep, an engine that rises with speed, an alarm),
                         canvas.js (the fixed, scaling canvas with a camera), lights.js (sun +
                         sky + exposure for a three.js scene that is not a world), sprites.js
                         (draws a generate_media actor with anims — one sheet PNG plus its manifest — by
                         facing, animation and time; a missing facing mirrors its opposite side).
                         Each header comment is its API; build.txt tells the model to read the
                         one it uses.

    codegen/             THE build path:
      build_chain.py     THE build DRIVER — what a finished llm turn does next. A build is a linear
                         chain of `llm` jobs tagged metadata.stage="build"; /worker/complete routes
                         here. advance() runs ALL local work — tool dispatch, staging —
                         synchronously and SUSPENDS only at a real inference (enqueue one llm job +
                         return; the process is free to die). Never more than one turn in flight per
                         run, and advance runs only in the control-plane process (completion handler
                         + reaper), so an in-process lock serializes them. kickoff/pause/resume/stop/
                         is_active/status_of are the API/CLI entry points. `kickoff(fresh=True)` is
                         the FROM-SCRATCH build: empty the game folder, then seed. Only the button
                         asks for it — a plain re-trigger, a resume and a fix all carry the folder
                         forward on purpose. It snapshots before deleting and preempts the art the
                         last attempt is still waiting on, since a render in flight would land in
                         the new folder and write itself into a manifest that never asked for it.
                         Without it a second attempt opens on the dead build's half-written files:
                         the model reads them, believes them, and re-asks for art it already has
                         under new ids (measured 2026-08-01: three naming schemes for one cast, 40
                         renders, no finished game). `stop` ends EVERYTHING the run has in
                         flight, at whatever stage it is in, and KEEPS what it wrote (the owner
                         reaches it over their own runs, an operator over ANY —
                         `routers/admin.py`, which is the hand on a run renting cards for
                         somebody else): every job the
                         run owns on every queue fails and releases its reservation — the design's
                         llm turn, the build's, the art behind it, a world's legs — claimed ones
                         included, since the worker holding one may be the thing that hung. Every
                         open builds row records `stopped`, which is what REFUSES a job a lingering
                         thread enqueues afterwards. A build with a cursor is finalized where it
                         stands, playability judged as it is at the step cap (an index.html) — a
                         run ended by hand over a game that runs is not a run that failed — and a
                         run still being DESIGNED ends `failed` with its ask left as the prompt,
                         so the page has something to rebuild from. `pause` DEQUEUES: a
                         still-queued turn is cancelled and its step refunded, a claimed one is left
                         to its worker and applied when it lands, and the build parks at the ENQUEUE
                         boundary rather than the top of advance. That boundary is what makes pause
                         cost nothing: parking at the top discarded a turn the GPU had already been
                         paid for, and announced itself on every reaper re-drive (one feed line
                         every 5s, forever). A refused compute budget PREEMPTS the run's
                         still-pending asset jobs before giving up — gameplay beats art. A landed
                         turn is ARCHIVED to the run dir before its jobs row is emptied
                         (`turn_log`) — append first, so there is never a moment with neither copy.
      build_steps.py     the turn MACHINE: step(spec, run_dir, tools, cursor, result, error)
                         -> Infer|Done.
                         A `result` of None is NO TURN TO APPLY (a resume, a reaper re-drive) and
                         re-asks from the transcript as it stands; `{}` is a turn that ran and
                         answered with nothing, which the nudge branch handles; an `error` is a turn
                         the WORKER could not deliver, which is neither. Collapsing any two of the
                         three scolds the model for a reply it never sent and burns a turn.
                         Owns the ONE tool schema — the model writes a PROGRAM and `pyexec.runner`
                         runs it — the LEDGER of what that program called (which is what the feed
                         line, the repeat note and the `done` signal are all read off, since a
                         program's calls are not in its arguments),
                         the transcript, compaction (`CLAUDE.md`; the note it ends with carries
                         `code_map`), the DONE-NUDGE (`cursor.done_nudged` — asked
                         once, then the next `done` is taken), and
                         every way a reply TOO BIG TO LAND arrives. A reply cut off before any tool
                         call is DISCARDED and the turn re-sent, carrying nothing into the
                         transcript; the other two are answered with the one remedy (write it in
                         pieces) because the model can act on them: the call whose ARGUMENTS stop
                         mid-write (unreadable, so nothing ran — reported as the truncation it is,
                         never as the missing `path` it parses to), and the 500 the inference
                         server's own tool-call parser returns for an oversized call. Measured 2026-08-01: one 64 KB
                         write_file reported as `KeyError: 'path'`, resent identically, four server
                         500s scored as silence, a dead build at step 28. A failing call resent with
                         identical arguments is COUNTED and the count told back; what to do instead
                         is the model's call. That count is keyed PER CALL, not against the previous
                         one: a model stuck on an edit re-reads the file between attempts, and a
                         succeeding read between two identical failures must not clear the ledger
                         (measured 2026-07-29: 12 identical failing edits, each scored as the first).
                         A read reaches the transcript as the FILE (`<file path=…>`), never
                         serialized — a JSON body shows every quote as \" and the model copies that
                         into old_text, where it matches nothing (measured 2026-07-28: 17 of one
                         build's 32 turns, resent byte-identical).
      build_state.py     the durable build CURSOR (runs/<id>/build_state.json) — phase, step count,
                         the PAUSE flag, the done-nudge flag, the growing transcript, and the
                         read→edit tool grounding, rehydrated into build_tools each completion (a
                         fresh process would else refuse a resumed edit). Job metadata carries only
                         {stage,run_id,build_id}; this file is the single source the completion
                         reloads, advances, rewrites. Pause lives here and not in memory: a control
                         plane that restarts mid-build holds nothing, while its turns keep
                         completing.
      turn_log.py        the run dir's own copy of the conversation (runs/<id>/turns.jsonl), and
                         the only one that lasts: a turn's request IS the transcript so far, so a
                         payload per jobs row stored the same conversation once per turn (951 MB of
                         `jobs.payload`, 26 MB for one 117-turn build). The system prompt and the
                         eight schemas are byte-identical every turn, so they ride ONE `meta` record
                         and a `turn` record carries only what that turn ADDED — turn k is
                         `system + tools + concat(added[0..k])`. A `compact` record carries the
                         rounds `build_steps.compact` trimmed to stubs and dropped, and the note
                         it ended with; the newest-copy-wins pass and the read-only-round drop are
                         functions of the transcript alone, so a replay shows what was really
                         sent. A FIX appends its own meta and never truncates.
      file_state.py      what the build has READ and whether it still says the same thing: every
                         read records the whole file's digest, and a compaction's note lists the
                         files that are byte for byte what the model was shown. Rendered at the
                         cut, never per turn — a per-turn block changes the prompt prefix and
                         costs more in lost cache than the read it saves.
      code_map.py        the project as one message: every source file, what it imports, and each
                         declaration — exported or private, and the functions one level inside it
                         — with the line range it occupies. Regex over JavaScript, no parser;
                         art, `world/` and the vendored renderer are left out. It is what the
                         compaction note re-grounds the model on, and with `read_file`'s `offset`
                         and `lines` it turns "read the file" into "read lines 68-120".
      archive.py         the run dir's OFF-BOX copy. tools/s3.py is a minimal SigV4 client over
                         `requests` — a wrong signature is a loud 403 and the payload hash rides
                         the request, so a signing bug cannot silently succeed. A settled finalize
                         (no gate fix kicked, not stopped by hand) uploads the run dir as one
                         tar.gz,
                         minus a world's `world_build/` — the world a game plays was published
                         into the game folder, and the stages' working material is hundreds of
                         megabytes nothing reads back. `evict` reclaims local disk and REFUSES without a verified remote
                         copy or under an active build; `rehydrate` pulls it back and re-stages;
                         `ensure_local` hooks play-session/build/change so an evicted game is a
                         download away. A boundary like snapshots: an unconfigured bucket logs and
                         stands aside.
      snapshots.py       the game folder's HISTORY, in git: `runs/<id>/game.git` is the repo and
                         `game/` its work tree, so nothing appears inside the folder the model
                         lists, staging copies and /play serves. A commit at every finalize that
                         produced a playable game, and one before a fix edits — a fix re-edits code
                         that already worked, so the last playable version is exactly what it can
                         destroy. Everything in the folder is committed, art included: a restore
                         that leaves half the game at another version is not a restore. git is a
                         BOUNDARY — a snapshot that cannot be taken is logged and the build carries
                         on, since losing history is not a reason to lose a game.
      pyexec/            where a model-written PROGRAM runs. `runner.run(code, tools)` answers
                         with what it printed, the ledger of what it called, and whether it was
                         refused, raised or ran out of time.
                         seccomp.py — the filter a process installs on ITSELF (`prctl`, via
                         ctypes, no dependency and no privileges): open, exec, socket, clone and
                         the rest denied outright. A DENY list is only enough because the confined
                         program needs nothing from the kernel — every path and every render goes
                         to the parent.
                         child.py — imports first (openat is gone afterwards), filter second,
                         model code third; a filter that will not install exits rather than
                         running the program free.
                         rpc.py — length-prefixed JSON over one socket, one call in flight.
                         runner.py — spawns the child with a scrubbed environment, serves each
                         call from `build_tools`, caps the calls and the wall clock, and runs
                         `check` first as a courtesy, never as the boundary (`CLAUDE.md`).
      tools.py           list_files / read_file / write_file / edit_file / generate_media /
                         compose_world / check_syntax / done — the smallest surface that works,
                         and kept that way. They are FUNCTIONS the program calls, so a failure
                         comes back as a value it can read rather than an exception that abandons
                         the rest of the program. `read_file` returns the WHOLE file however long:
                         the ceiling was a context guard, and a read lands in a variable, not the
                         window. `check_syntax` is the error gate's own module parser per file —
                         node reads `export` in a `.js` as a CommonJS failure and answers "retry as
                         a module" with status 0, so a game checked as a script is always clean —
                         and it resolves every local path a file names, index.html included, so a
                         `./lib/audio.js` written from a subfolder is reported rather than shipped:
                         the file parses, and a browser reports the missing module on the console
                         instead of as the uncaught exception the error gate watches for. Art still
                         queued for rendering is not a missing file.
                         `done` does nothing but carry its summary: the driver reads it off the
                         ledger.
                         compose_world is worldgen's build face: one 3D world per game, refused
                         a second time because the game is already written against the first
                         one's metres and regions. A path is resolved and must land inside the
                         game folder. Every failure is REPORTED to the model as text (a missing
                         argument names itself) and never guessed at: substituting a default for a
                         missing `path` sent every write in a run to one file.
                         `read_file` on a missing path the manifest lists as requested answers
                         PENDING — keep the path, do not re-ask — never "no such file": the
                         error reading as a failed ask made a build re-request its whole set
                         under "-v2" ids (11 duplicates, 2026-08-03), and ok=True keeps the
                         repeat ledger from scolding a legitimate second look.
                         `read_file` returns a WINDOW of whole lines from a 1-based `offset`. Both
                         halves are load-bearing: a window cut mid-line is text the model cannot
                         reproduce and it copies the cut into old_text, and without `offset` the
                         tail past the ceiling is unreachable, so an edit there can never land
                         (measured 2026-07-29: 12 byte-identical edits, 248 of 249 chars matching,
                         the 249th the cut). A window that stops short says where the rest is and
                         that a file this size is worth splitting.
      staging.py         where a game lives (runs/<id>/game/) and how it reaches the browser: copy
                         the folder to runtime/games/<run_id>/. No bundle, no transform.
                         `has_authored_files` discounts the seed, so it says whether a BUILD wrote
                         anything — which is what offers the from-scratch button. Also the SEED
                         (seed_vendor): the game folder starts holding the vendored renderer and
                         `lib/` and nothing else, since everything placed there steers the
                         first list_files. It runs on EVERY kickoff and never overwrites.
      assets.py          the ASSET stage — `request_media` is what the game's generate_media call
                         runs. The ask is STRUCTURED: `kind` (sprite, actor, tile, scene, mesh),
                         `subject` (prose, no style words), `style` (the game's one phrase) and
                         `details` — the facts prose cannot carry: body plan, view, anims and
                         facings, accepted on every kind and animated only for an actor today.
                         `compose_prompt` renders them to the one prose string the samplers see
                         (style, subject, view), so where the style sits is a measurable edit
                         here rather than whatever the builder typed, and `render_kind` maps an
                         actor to the pipeline's sprite or anim leg. Then: enqueue ONE `image`
                         job, record the ask in assets.json, write a
                         PLACEHOLDER at the path (a matted disc for a sprite, mesh or anim, an
                         opaque frame for a tile or scene — an anim's placeholder is that disc as
                         a one-frame sheet with its manifest beside it, so `lib/sprites.js` loads
                         it like any other) and answer with the path. The game
                         never loads a file that is not there — a `drawImage` of a broken image
                         throws every frame — and the manifest's `placeholder` flag, cleared by
                         the landing op, is what "rendered" means everywhere a bare file check
                         used to (`landed`). Nothing plans, rewrites or inspects the game's source. `kind`
                         picks the model, the workflow and what a landed render owes: sprite is
                         matted and autocropped because the game draws it ON its own background,
                         scene keeps the whole frame because it IS the background, a tile is
                         quilted seamless (`tools/quilting.py`, in `asset_chain._save_flat` —
                         soft, a quilt that throws saves the raw render), mesh chains image →
                         TRELLIS (its image leg is a Qwen-Image subject render, framed and
                         matted, in a hand-painted game-asset style the player never sees —
                         TRELLIS lifts a stylized cut-out far better than a photo or an anime
                         sprite, `docs/experiments.md` 2026-09-03) and lands normalized to 1 unit at its longest side, which the
                         tool's answer states: placement code cannot discover scale any other
                         way, and an untold model shipped a knee-high lighthouse. An anim chains
                         image → the `video` queue's `anim_sheet` job (`tools/comfyui_tools.build_anim_payload`,
                         `worker/anim_sheet.py`), which turns the matted sprite render into one
                         directional sheet via MiniMax-H3 image-to-video — see the anim ledger
                         entry below and `docs/experiments.md` 2026-09-04. Rendering every
                         kind through one item-icon path matted a game's floor tiles down to a
                         handful of planks — it said "tile" in every prompt and nothing could
                         hear it. A refused compute budget is answered as "draw this one with
                         code instead", never left as a path that will never fill. `check_render` reads the alpha of what landed against the kind
                         that was asked for and records a `defect` on the manifest entry: a matte
                         that never ran, one that ate the subject, a background full of holes. It
                         may only find BROKEN — whether a picture suits the game is the same human
                         question as whether the game plays right, so the gallery SHOWS the defect
                         and nothing acts on it. An already-rendered file, a blocked prompt
                         and a refused budget are all answered, never retried blind. A REPEATED id
                         is answered ONCE and then obeyed — the done-nudge shape: the first repeat
                         says "not requeued, call again to replace it", the second re-renders and
                         rewrites the entry's prompt. Silently keeping the old picture was worse
                         than either, because "redraw these" got agreement and no new art.
                         Also owns start_from_manifest (the TOP-UP: re-render what the record says
                         is still missing) and the single-asset regenerate — the user's text is a
                         CHANGE NOTE merged (one small llm call) with the entry's original prompt,
                         so "give him a red cape" keeps the goblin; img2img seeds from the render.
                         A top-up RESUMES a mesh from its `<id>.src.png` if one is there: the chain
                         needs ComfyUI and then TRELLIS, and a one-GPU box holds one at a time, so
                         always restarting at the image leg never reached the second half.
      design.py          the DESIGNER — the one inference between the user's words and the build.
                         One llm call (prompts/design.txt) turns spec.json's `ask` (the words,
                         verbatim, kept for the human to see) into `request` (a 900–1400-word
                         systems design: the systems named, every entity a record with fields,
                         structure from seeded generators with verifiers, numbers given, art named
                         as art, screens as a state machine — `CLAUDE.md`). `request` is what
                         builds; it is absent while the design is pending. Web: an llm job tagged
                         metadata.stage="design", whose completion writes `request`, emits
                         `prompt_proposed` and KICKS OFF THE BUILD — no human reads the design
                         first; a failed or empty design writes `request = ask` and builds on
                         that. A kickoff the budget refuses leaves the run designed and idle, and
                         the page's Build button retries it. The built page renders `request` as
                         headed sections read from its shape (the lead line, the SYSTEMS list, one
                         section per NAME: paragraph) over the SAME string the edit box holds
                         and a rebuild sends — a view, never a second copy. CLI: synchronous,
                         and the build is the CLI's own next call. The
                         create call is where the game is charged — the credit, and the
                         compute-seconds grant the queue meters against (`db_store.charge_game`,
                         through `tools/execution_context.run_scope`): the design is the game's
                         first inference, on a build row of its own (`kind=design`), and the
                         build that follows never charges again. Measured 2026-08-26
                         (`docs/experiments.md`): the model's design of a plain request built a
                         game "a million times better" than three stages of the request itself.
      error_gate.py      the ERROR GATE — after a playable finalize, open the run dir's `game/`
                         (what was just staged) in a headless browser (playwright chromium, an ephemeral static server),
                         screenshot it, ask the model what the title screen offers
                         (prompts/probe_targets.txt: buttons as pixel centres, keys the screen
                         names — at most MAX_TARGETS of each, one llm turn at low effort,
                         charged to the game), press each on its own fresh page, and re-enter
                         the fix machine with the FIRST uncaught error and its address. A model
                         that cannot be asked or answers off-shape leaves the fixed poke (one
                         click at the viewport centre + Enter + Space). The address — a script the page asked for and did not get (an import that
                         404s, which stops the module graph without throwing) counts as one, with
                         the path as its address. One error per fix
                         build; node --check supplies the file:line a browser SyntaxError omits
                         (tried as module then script — authored games import three); a
                         redeclaration note lists every declaration site; a parse note says fix
                         the whole file. Stops on MAX_ROUNDS, on the same error two rounds
                         running, and never touches a build a human stopped. A probe that cannot
                         run logs and stands aside — the gate is a boundary like snapshots.
                         Round state in runs/<id>/error_gate.json.
      play_gate.py       the PLAY GATE (branch experiment) — after the error gate is clean, play
                         the staged game in the same no-egress headless browser: one persistent
                         page, one session of MAX_TURNS llm turns. Each turn the model sees the
                         current screenshot, presses ONE input (key, click, or a held key), states
                         the VISIBLE change it expects, and next turn says met / unmet / unclear
                         about its own prediction (prompts/play_turn.txt — the design rides along
                         so the model knows the documented controls). A closing call
                         (prompts/play_verdict.txt) folds the session into runs/<id>/play_report.json:
                         `broken` — inputs it pressed and WATCHED fail, biased to under-report
                         (unclear is not broken, failed-once-worked-later is not broken) — and
                         `judgment`, a written impression that only ever reaches the human, never
                         a fix note (a grade as a fix note made nothing better — experiments.md
                         2026-08-08). One broken fact re-enters the fix machine per round
                         (prompts/play_fix_note.txt); stops at MAX_ROUNDS or the same fact twice
                         running. A session that cannot run logs and stands — boundary, like the
                         error gate. Round state in runs/<id>/play_gate.json.
      asset_use.py       does the game LOAD the art it asked for — static analysis over the game's
                         own source, no model and no GPU. Two facts: an asset the source never
                         names (paid for, never seen) and an `assets/…` path in neither the manifest
                         nor the folder (a broken image, and no top-up can fill it because nothing
                         ever asked). An asset still RENDERING is neither — it is in the manifest,
                         so the source naming it is right. It rides the DONE-NUDGE, which is already
                         the one place the build asks what is unfinished and is asked ONCE.
                         Matching is generous one way and literal the other so the count
                         under-reports: an id named ANYWHERE counts as loaded (a game may build
                         `"assets/" + id + ".png"` at runtime), while a missing path must be written
                         out in full. The vendored renderer is not the game's source — GLTFLoader
                         discusses `assets/` paths in its comments.
      asset_chain.py     what a finished asset job does NEXT — the names in its `metadata.then`: a
                         CONTINUATION to enqueue (mesh_from_image, anim_from_image), OPERATIONS on
                         this result (save_sprite / save_flat / decimate / save_anim), and the
                         batch's FINALIZE. It owns those
                         names so the queue stays a generic transport that never learns what an
                         asset is. Two finalizes: `assets` lands the art and leaves the build's
                         row to the build machine (a build turn's generate_media), `art_build`
                         lands it and ends the row, for a batch that IS its build (a top-up, a
                         regenerate). Every save runs the SAFETY policy first (`_admit`): the worker
                         attached NSFW scores to the render, `assets.render_verdict` decides, and
                         a refused (or verdict-less) render is deleted, marked on the manifest and
                         recorded as a violation — a refused mesh source never reaches TRELLIS.
                         `_anim_from_image` keeps the sprite render as `<id>.src.png` (a re-seed
                         needs an image, not a sheet) the same way a mesh does, and enqueues it on
                         the `video` queue; `_save_anim` writes the sheet PNG and its manifest to
                         the promised path together, admitted on the worst of the four facing
                         stills' NSFW scores since every frame descends from one of them.
      artifact_screen.py the artifact TEXT gate — the game folder's authored text through the same
                         narrow screen as every input seam, at finalize before staging. A hit
                         HOLDS the build: status `held`, not staged, not archived, play/build/change
                         refused, a neutral message to the owner, a row in the violations table
                         for the admin panel. The image side of the same policy is asset_chain's
                         `_admit` above.
      prompts/           build.txt (the one system prompt every build turn reads),
                         design.txt (the designer call), play_turn.txt / play_verdict.txt /
                         play_fix_note.txt (the play gate's session, closing report and fix
                         note), probe_targets.txt (the gate asking
                         where to press), error_gate_note.txt (the fix note an
                         uncaught error becomes).
      run.py             create_run / propose_prompt (the designer, synchronously) / set_prompt /
                         run_build (CLI: kickoff +
                         block-poll the cursor) / change_from_note + the CLI. The web build/change path is
                         fire-and-forget through build_chain.kickoff, not run.py.
    services.py          parse_args — any argument shape a local model returns → a dict.
                         parse_args_checked also says whether anything was READABLE: a call cut off
                         at the output cap and a call that carries no arguments both answer {}, and
                         only one of them is a failure.
    tool_calls.py        recovering a tool call the model wrote as TEXT, when the server's own
                         parser didn't claim it. A registry of encodings (Hermes/Qwen, DeepSeek,
                         Mistral, Llama python-tag, two XML forms, named object, arg-shape), tried
                         strictest first. A parser only wins if EVERY call it found names an offered
                         tool and carries that tool's required arguments.
    state.py             RunState — durable per-run dir <working_dir>/runs/<run_id>/ (spec.json —
                         `ask` the user's words, `request` what builds — and the game/ folder). Ownership + charge state live in db/, not the run dir.
  worldgen/              the 3D world behind the compose_world build tool: the worldclaw pipeline,
                         stage for stage, with every GPU call on maestro's queues. build.py runs the nine stages in order — scene, terrain-plan,
                         terrain-assets, construct, terrain-refine, regional-plan, objects,
                         scene-refine, final-render — and `start_at`/`stop_after` make any run of
                         them resumable, which is what lets one world be built in legs. planning/
                         and terrain/ and objects/ are the stages themselves; llm.py, backends/
                         images.py and backends/meshes.py are the only ways out to a card, each a
                         job on the llm, image or mesh queue. Each stage names its own sampling
                         temperature (the grounding pass is greedy, the planners are not) and its
                         own mesh seed, and both ride the job all the way to the server.
                         terrain/render.py is both the refinement loop's eyes and the contract:
                         it writes world.json and draws it in headless chromium through
                         runtime/vendor/world.js — the SAME loader the game imports, so the agent
                         never judges a picture the game cannot reproduce. Every path in
                         world.json is relative to the folder it sits in, which is what makes the
                         folder copyable into a game.
                         Each region is covered in a PAIR of squares, not one: the surface the
                         plan names and the variant it wears through to — grass to bare earth,
                         sand to cracked clay — both drawn as ground seen straight down (asked
                         for a lakebed, a diffusion model draws a lake, far bank and all, which
                         then tiles as a lattice of little lakes) and both quilted seamless by
                         `tools.quilting.quilt_tile`. The shader blends the pair by a fixed
                         recipe in world metres — low-frequency noise for the patches, slope to
                         carry a steep face over on its own — with the threshold above the
                         noise's mean, so a pasture reads as pasture with earth in it and not the
                         reverse. Nothing about the recipe is per-world: world.json carries the
                         two paths and one scale, and a region with no variant draws its base
                         alone. The ground is a MeshStandardMaterial with the splat injected into
                         its shader rather than a shader of its own, because a raw shader
                         receives no shadow map, fog or tone mapping — the sun has to cast onto
                         the terrain as it does onto everything else. On top of the blend the
                         material derives rock on steep faces, snow on the highest shallow ground
                         of regions the plan called high, and a two-scale albedo mix that stops
                         one tile reading as one tile over eight hundred metres — all from the
                         height field and the material already there, so none needs an asset or
                         a plan field. The stochastic tiling taps textureGrad on the unbroken
                         UV's gradients: a per-cell offset jump otherwise picks the smallest mip
                         and draws a dashed lattice over every close view.
                         compose.py is the build face. The tool BLOCKS through `construct` — the
                         first stage at which a world exists to write at all, since world.json
                         names the height field, the region materials and the scatter — and
                         answers with size_m and the regions in metres, because the model places
                         gameplay by region the turn it hears back. The rest runs on one thread
                         for that run, in three legs (terrain-refine / regional-plan..objects /
                         scene-refine..final-render), and PUBLISHES after each.
                         The publish contract: `<run_dir>/world_build/` holds the intermediates
                         (~275 MB of concept images, region compositions and refinement views) and
                         no game ever reads it; `<game>/world/` holds only what world.json names —
                         the json, heightmap.f32, the weight textures, each region's two albedos
                         and their normals, and the GLBs — at the same relative paths, so staging, archiving
                         and playing carry the world with the game and the game fetches nothing
                         outside its folder. world.json is rewritten from the world as it stands
                         at every publish and replaced by rename, so a browser never reads one
                         naming a file that is not there yet. A world with no meshes yet still
                         COLLIDES: the loader reads collision from stated heights, never from a
                         GLB. Nothing here blocks `done` — a build finalizes on a game whose
                         ground already loads while the scenery is still rendering — and a leg
                         that fails is logged and left, because the pipeline resumes by stage.
                         Locally the three queues are drained by `scripts/local_gpu.py auto`
                         (`docs/local_dev.md`).
```

The rest of the platform is build-path-agnostic: `auth/` (identity, bearer sessions, credits,
open signup — the only self-serve account path, per-IP throttled — the
/play handoff + per-game grant-cookie gate, `playgrants.py`; an account carries an EMAIL, which
exists to recover it: `/auth/forgot` mails a single-use link that answers identically for an address
with no account, and setting a password ends every session the account has), `db/`
(games/builds/events/jobs/workers + the compute budget), `worker/` (the pull-side GPU worker),
`scaler/` (the RunPod autoscaler), `api/` (FastAPI routers), `llm_clients/`, `tools/`, `config/`,
and `frontend/` (the React SPA, served same-origin by the API).

## Where inference happens

Only inside a build, as a chain of `llm` jobs, with art riding three more queues off the same
transport: `image` (sprite, tile, scene and mesh renders, TRELLIS), `mesh` (TRELLIS itself) and
`video` (`anim_sheet` — MiniMax-H3 image-to-video, turning one matted sprite render into a
directional sheet). The request paths, the completion dispatch and how
a new stage registers are in `docs/architecture.md` § Request paths.

## The art ledger

`generate_media` entered UNMEASURED (2026-07-28) and is still unsettled — art is the one capability
no `write_file` can stand in for. Counted over the 35 staged games (2026-08-01): 19 called it at all,
308 asks, 27 of them meshes across 6 builds — and the asks RATION. One 3D village asked for five NPC
portraits and a lighthouse while building five shops, a farm, lamp posts and every interior out of 27
code primitives. So the prompt does not tell the model to draw a plain shape at the spot, and the tool
does not price a render in minutes: both frame art as a thing that might not arrive, and a model
that believes that draws a prism and moves on.

What settles it is COVERAGE — how much of what the player sees got art — not call-at-all. A build
whose art never lands renders its placeholders (2026-08-24: before them, a card game drew a
never-landed webp and was black every frame).

Coverage, counted (2026-08-01, `asset_use.audit` over the 35 staged games): 352 assets asked for,
**128 rendered and never referenced by the game's source**, and **115 `assets/…` paths referenced
that were never asked for**. One ghost game asked for all 11 of its assets before writing a line of
code, wrote the game with 89 canvas primitives, read its own `assets.json`, and loaded none of them.
One card game rendered 67 and used none, while shipping 114 paths under an `assets/cards/` folder
that does not exist. The tool answers with a path and never learns whether the path was used, so
until the audit nothing in the loop could see either half. Orphaning is NOT the recent prompt edit: a
build carrying the older "draw a plain shape at that spot" line orphaned 7 of its 8.

`anim` is the newest kind — one call per thing that moves, with the build naming its animations
(`anims`: name + action) and its facings (4 from a turntable clip, or 1 for a top-down or flat
thing the game rotates), and it comes back as a sheet of those rather than the single image every
other kind returns. Cost is real: each (animation, facing) is one ~8 s clip plus a 20 s turntable
for a four-facing thing — a knight with walk, idle and attack facing four ways is ~2 minutes of GPU
(`docs/experiments.md` 2026-09-04) — so the same rationing pressure that thins mesh asks applies
here: fewer facings (mirroring covers left/right) or fewer animations are the levers, not a
smaller sheet.
