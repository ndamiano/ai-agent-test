"""Durable on-disk state for one game build.

Each game gets its own run directory under <working_directory>/runs/<run_id>/.
Inside it:
  - spec.json             the run's PROMPT ({request, title}) — what the build sends as its
                          user message, and what the human approved
  - build_state.json      the durable build cursor (maestro.codegen.build_state)
  - turns.jsonl           every llm turn the run has spent (maestro.codegen.turn_log) — the
                          archive, once the jobs row that carried it is emptied
  - game/                 the browser files the model wrote — written directly by
                          maestro.codegen.tools
  - game.git/             that folder's history (maestro.codegen.snapshots) — the repo sits beside
                          the work tree so nothing shows up inside game/
