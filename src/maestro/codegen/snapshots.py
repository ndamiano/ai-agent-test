"""The game folder's history, kept in git.

A fix re-edits code that already worked, so the last playable version is exactly what a fix round
can destroy. One commit is taken at every finalize that produced a playable game, and one before a
fix starts editing.

The repository is `<run_dir>/game.git` and its work tree is `<run_dir>/game`, so nothing appears
inside the folder the model lists, staging copies, and `/play` serves. Everything in the folder is
committed — art and the vendored renderer included — because a restore that leaves half the game at
another version is not a restore.

git is a boundary, not a dependency of the build: a snapshot that cannot be taken is logged and the
build carries on. Losing history is not a reason to lose a game.
